# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0: March 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Bootstraped the project. I'm going to use Lavarel and VueJS to build the project.

**Thoughts:** I think this project will help me to grasp most of the parts of the entire stack since I will have to create and configure a server, work on the front, the back, play with rules and roles, etc ... I will update the stack as I go through the building (maybe add some queueing, http cache, redis cache etc ...).
UI/UX and CSS will be the most challenging parts for me since it is not my string suits but I'll get better by doing

### Day 1: March 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Following up on the project bootstraping.

**Thoughts** Creating the basics layouts of the app. The goal is to have a working infrastructure so that I can add up to the app later (add UI / UX and the javascript parts). Started to add the basis of Localization

### Day2: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still Bootstraping the project.

**Thoughts**: I am starting to create the basis of the project logic. I've been learning and working with form request validation in Laravel.

## Day3: March 21, 2018

**Todays Progress**: Still working the foundation

**Thoughts**: Further work on validation and Localization. Starting to think about an internationalization strategy (internationalization keys files)
